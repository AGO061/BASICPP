# BASIC++

Use new and simple features to make your PET BASIC V2 Application!

## Currently the compiler supports:
### Constants
### Functions
### Automatic Line Enumeration + Line Skipper
### Comment Remover
### GOTO Pointers

## About the examples:
I'll try to make the examples work with all flags (it might not be 100% possible)
In the next update i'll try to add flags to the files
